    Chole Bhature also known as Chana Bhatura is one of the most popular Punjabi dish liked almost all over India. Chole stands for a spiced tangy chickpea curry and Bhatura is a soft and fluffy fried leavened bread.

    In this recipe post, I have included the step by step method of making the chickpea curry as well as a quick no yeast bhatura.
    Chana Bhatura is a spicy, tasty and a filling dish. I have eaten this dish at many places in Punjab and Delhi. Each restaurants or dhaba (eateries on highways) have their own flavors and taste in the chickpea curry. In some places the curry is very spicy, at other places it has tangy taste and the consistency of the curry also varies from slightly thick to semi-dry and dry.
    his recipe has spicy flavors. This is my mom’s recipe and unlike other versions of chickpea curry recipes posted on the blog, this one has a homely taste and flavor. It does not taste like the restaurant or dhaba versions but taste very good.

Even the bhature size and flavor varies from restaurants to restaurants. The bhature ideally should be less oily and should puff fully. They should also be eaten hot and fresh. If you parcel the bhature from a restaurant then you won’t get the real taste as they become limp and dense.

I always make the bhatura recipes that are already posted on the blog. I have not yet tried making any other version of bhatura as these work best for me always.

masala dosa recipe | crispy masale dose | how to make masala dosa with detail photo and video recipe. an easy and popular, tasty south indian staple breakfast recipe made with rice and urad dal. basically an extension to the traditional dosa recipe, where dosa is made crisp and stuffed with potato masala. it is perhaps one of the famous dish from south india, which is can be served for morning breakfast or also as an evening snack with coconut chutney and sambar.
well, there is a great story about the origin of the famous masale dosa. there are many stories around india, but according to wiki, it originated from my hometown udupi. it was here in udupi, the dosa’s were made crisp and served. one of the local restaurants in udupi started to serve potato masala stuffed dosa as a variation and also to lower the coconut chutney consumption. those days, coconut-based dishes were considered pricey and dosa’s cannot be consumed without any side dish. gradually stuffed dosa became one of the norms and the migrant community took this variety to mumbai and exposed to a broader audience. it was very well received in the cosmopolitan city and that’s how it became one of the popular dose variety.
