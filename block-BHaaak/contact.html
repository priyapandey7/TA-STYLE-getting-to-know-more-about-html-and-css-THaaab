     <p><h2>Stop Thinking, Just Execute</h2>
        it’s not just as easy as knowing you have to do it and thus doing it.
        There are powerful reasons we don’t finish what we start and follow through very often.
        These reasons can generally be split into two camps: inhibiting tactics and psychological roadblocks.

        Inhibiting tactics are the ways we plan against ourselves without even realizing it.
        
        They include: -<br>
        
        (1) setting bad goals,<br>
        
        (2) procrastination,<br>
        
        (3) indulging in temptations and distractions, and<br>
        
        (4) poor time management.<br>
        
        Psychological roadblocks are the ways we don’t follow through because we are unconsciously protecting ourselves.
        
        These include :<br>
        
        (1) laziness and lack of discipline,
        
        (2) fear of judgment, rejection, and failure,
     </p>
     <p>
         <h3> It’s all worthwhile. </h3>

         Holding the belief that hard work can and will lead to improvement

         You need to believe in your own abilities and
         
         trust in your opportunities. Don’t create self-limiting beliefs that hold you back.
         
         Believe what you are doing is valuable and relevant to your goals
         
         Mindset 2: Become comfortable with  discomfort.
         
         Everything you want to do will have elements of discomfort, unless you just want to watch television all day by yourself.
         
         Overcoming your instinct to avoid things just because they are uncomfortable

     </p>
     <p><h3>Consider Risks</h3>
        eing hypervigilant about what may go wrong is a tactic employed by highly successful and productive people like Bill Gates

        Be paranoid and start to question what could go wrong. Think about making contingency plans
        
        
         
        Be sure to ask yourself how you might lose out if you delay taking action at this moment
        
        Chapter 6. No Distraction Zone
        Minimize your distractions in your environment. It turns out that out of sight is out of mind with distractions
        
        Create default actions wherever possible. This is where the easiest and lowest resistance past for you is the path you want the most.

     </p>
<p>even if you do not reach a goal.

    Keep a scoreboard for everything large and trivial. This keeps you motivated and striving toward growth and progress.
    
    Lower your transaction costs by making undesirable behaviors inconvenient and unwieldy while making desirable behaviors convenient and easy
    
    Gather all of the information and materials you need all at once and before you get started. This allows you to work interruption-free and gather momentum.
    
    <strong> Finish what you start !</strong>
