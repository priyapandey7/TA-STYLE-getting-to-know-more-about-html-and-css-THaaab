        When you look at your life, you have to understand that you must take all the responsibility for where you are right now. Your current situation is the product of your thoughts and actions up to this point.
        When you find yourself unhappy with the way things are going in your life it may be time to make a change. You can’t change the direction of the wind but you can change the way you face it and deal with it. The situation does not go away because you don’t look at it.
        Look at what you want to change in your life and begin by finding a change within yourself in how you look at it, how you approach it. The situation, just like the sails of a boat shift against the wind, will have no choice but to also alter and change with you.
        Change is hard.
        It’s even harder when it’s a big change — breaking up with someone you love, leaving your old job, starting your own business, or hundreds of other difficult choices.

       <h2>
        Overcoming Fear to Make Big Life Change
       </h2>
       We often avoid making important decisions because we want more information before we make a tough call.
       Yes, it’s certainly true that you need to do your research … but if you’re waiting for the crystal clear answer to come to you, then you’re going to be waiting a long time. As humans, we are curious creatures and our need for information can be paralyzing us.
       Ask yourself, “What’s the worst that could happen?”
       Once you realize the worst isn’t that bad, you’ll be ready to crush it.
       Have enough courage to trust yourself. No matter what happens, you’ll figure out a way to make it work.
       You can’t change the wind, but you can change your sails.
       From this moment, you now have the awareness that you can change your emotions (sails) around any situation (wind) that has occurred in your life, and you can change the meaning to something that serves you and takes you in the direction you truly desire to go.

        <h3> Try to deal with the problems </h3>
        Life is filled with all kinds of surprises, both good and bad, but we must not allow misfortune to be showstopper for our journey. We can adjust sails to reach our destination.
        The sailing ships can adjust  their sails in order to move in one direction regardless of which way the wind was blowing. But we  can't control the random circumstances and obstacles that come our  way, but can adapt and adjust our plans in order to stay on track and achieve our goal.
        So many times we fight off circumstances and events. We do everything within our to try and resist the changes that confront us. Change is like the wind blowing a sail boat through the open ocean. To resist change is to fight against the inevitable and all powerful forces of life. We cannot change the fate but we can Change the way to reach desired goal.
        We should always keep in mind  that despite what life throws at us, there are ways and means of altering our course and adjusting our sails!.

        If your parents decide to move from your old place to new one and you are totally mad about it because you will be going away from your friends, memories to a completely new place. Instead of hating your parents for that or keeping bad attitude "Thomas S. Monson" suggest to adjust your attitude and deal with it!
        We cannot direct the winds but we can adjust our sails.
        Think about this for a minute.  It has so many applications to our lives, whether we are depressed or not.  The underlying message is that many things happen in our lives that we might not prefer and that we cannot avoid or change.  The “winds” here represent the external influences, other people, mother nature, and what life throws at you.  Sometimes it’s a loss of a loved one or a job, an illness, or when things just don’t go your way.  They all can have a powerful impact and contribute to the course of our lives.  Sometimes we can’t do anything about the wind, these forces in life, other than adapt to them and adjust our approach.  A strong wind comes, or changes direction, and our best response is to tinker with the sails to avoid sinking our boat.  When things happen that are challenges in life, we can take steps and “adjust our sails” to modify the circumstances in our own behalf or better cope with them.  A reader wrote in to remind us that we can have hurricanes in our lives, and our sails get tattered and torn. Yet somehow he or she is still here to demonstrate her resilience.  Overall we must try to be flexible in life, constantly adjusting ourselves and our path in response to the world.
